<p>
I’ve got some idea where I want this to go. Not enough though to make it fun to write without the kind of thinking you do when you’re stuck and on a deadline. I’m not on a deadline; I do not mind when this is done. So, until I’m siezed by intrigue, this will stay here incomplete.

<p class="verse">
A spaceman came travelling, some hero of a world bygone.<br />
The flash dazed me from my home; I followed its path along<br />
the pleated streak of spectral fire that announced his rite on earth.<br />
As he emerged, bewildering me, in a starless night I searched.<br />
<br />
Buried in his destructed craft, illuminated by light I shone,<br />
leapt from debris, he siezed my torch. We jostled before it tripped.<br />
I was struck scared, cursered under my breath but settled me did his:<br />
A friendly heat in the dark: offerings of amnesty.<br />
<br />
A spaceman came travelling, of a world beheld by death.<br />
I craned my neck to inspect him as moonlight bloomed his breath.<br />
Hunger had made his body frail, I saw he needed rest.<br />
His desperation graced me; I took his weight and left.<br />
