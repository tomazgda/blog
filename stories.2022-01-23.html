Something I found lying around on a filesystem. I like to start projects, less so finish them but <i>hey</i> enjoy the opening! The formatting may be weird; it hasn't been proof read. Maybe all of it’s weird; still, if you want, give it a go&#x2026;

It is straightforward enough of a task to compel one to torture. That is assuming they have sufficient need for certain information and its acquisition is only attainable though such means. Anyone would torture to save someone they loved. To compel to murder is arguably easier, though only if in self-defence or more broadly, as a preventative measure; slightly harder if the murder is an act of revenge. But nevertheless, painless - simply convince the proposed transgressor of a personal evil done to them. And let the brisk, revengeful rampage commence. What is finally tricky then, is this: to compel to torture when information is worthless. To get one to enact needless suffering is more effort than it is worth. Unless of course they’re insane.
</p>

<p>
Michael wasn’t insane, nor did he consider himself a murderer. Well, not in the context of the past five minutes at least. He was just, he convinced himself, very upset. That didn’t seem a justification suitable for the sprawl-ing phlebotomised sectors of a man that now decorated the room. What compelled Michael, he concluded, was that this was relatively quaint - good, old fashioned murder - compared with the life he had led up to this point. And that he hadn’t, until now, realised his sins. And that now he had, he realised it was all the fault of the dead man. So he ought to be dead; except, in hindsight, if he weren’t, he could probably have told Michael why everything that had happened had.
</p>

<p>
He produced from the inner linings of his jacket a worn notebook, flicking desperately through the loved pages, past yonks of sketches and calculations, til the book parted in halves. There, across double spread, he had captured, from his best recollection, every detail of her portrait. Far from a talented artist, Michael had achieved such immaculacy merely through the sacrifice of time. An extraction of a life of company from a night screened by guilt bore, as such a task would, hours of commitment in their thousands. Indubitably he did not do this in vain; the benefits of his infatuation were numerous, to wit, he could see her, finally - again.
</p>

<p>
‘That is -’, her voice began; her legs, with haste - with composed stealth - bringing her to ground from a seated position atop the control panel in front. A panel, so bleak in construct, so void of decor, that it welcomed its newfound hemic adornment. ‘From the King’s vaults on Rimini’. She hovered about the millenia aged notebook, her gaze never leaving Michael’s. ‘He collected technology that couldn’t be understood; he claimed his catalogue of instruments an archive of magic.’ She ran her finger along the seem of her illustration, the two halves merging into a whole, contiguous page. And shut the book with startling hurry, her figure unflinching. ‘You went the Rubicon - to the legislative sector, your following securing the apparatus of rule, dealing with the criminals who deployed them. And, while there, pur-suing his majesty, you unearthed this book - a parting gift.’ She returned the artefact to Michael’s chest adjacent pocket, failing to return her hand now bridging her and he. A contiguity of bodies and a very uncontiguous corpse: connection in the midst of death, just as it had been the first time. Michael felt the earnest advance as she drew closer; she moved first quickly, then gradually less so, intent on meeting her mouth with his. Though ardent her conviction, across the passage of time, she seemed an eternity away. So he rid the world of the paradox; Michael moved to her, expeditiously brought his lips to hers, sealed each arm round waste and torso - all the while his eyes closed. As he did so, he felt only a sickening awakening to reality and, after endless seconds in darkened solitude, bore the sore of his vision. He looked across a loveless room and sank to floor of man’s debris, collapsed without the support of another.
</p>

<p>
He grew to his feet, scathing unto the eyes of a decapitated head two paces to his right. Briefly, he contemplated gouging them from their capture; per-haps they had conspired against the tyrant who had failed to see his assassin approach. Michael discarded any plans. By now, any further abuse offended him. Turning his back to the head, he took a hand from the floor’s extremity buffet, pressing it to a biometric scanner aside the exit. The pneumatic door hissed open, sulking into floor and ceiling. Michael hesitated, mocking the reluctance of the appliance before clearing the warped aperture. Outside, his shadow lurked beneath him, animated by a reddened illumination from the room before. The door sealed behind, leaving only specs of manufactured light across the mechanical stretches of terrain. Fumes of industry blotted out the stars that should have prospected the ceaseless black above. No sun stood to combat the sombre; no sun would, nothing comforted the edge of space. Michael reproached the synthetic world, glaring in panorama, averse even to breathing the atmospheric bubble that enclosed him. He gave in, let in a gasp, shrugging off his quibbles with the establishment. From his jacket, he again produced the notebook. The cover read, appropriately: ’Notes’. He shook the book, the letters obediently rearranging, piecing together a title anew: ’Letters Volume One’. This process he repeated, as to check all nine volumes were still there. On the ninth, he opened to a page at random, absorbing a serving of the life a dialogue. Written conversations to and fro, her and he, across treks of space. Death could not stand between them. Michael’s desire was overbearing, convicted beyond the realm of the sane. Truth was no obstacle; he could reconstruct his companion. He had their story: life together. They had died together, and now, here he was in the after. Life after his death. That had to be it. That had to be his closure.

To circumnavigate Hesperia, that is the island of, one has only to turn to the planet’s sole inter-collective administration: ‘The Locomotive Authority’, ‘L.A’. They oversee the function and development - though progress is scarce - of one train and one line. The railway track runs the circumference of the island at a seldom deviating altitude. A hundred metres above ocean: the stone sleepers lie, the brass rails run. The Elder’s wrought ceaselessly to construct such a line able to bear an unbroken schedule. Along it, at ninety-eight imperial metres per seconds, blitzes the L.A-4: the fourth iteration of the organisation’s steam locomotives.
</p>

<p>
The Island of Hesperia blesses in natural resource an abundance of copper and zinc as well as an infestation of greenery, barely kept on leash by human settlements. The L.A-4 cuts through fifteen thousand metric kilometres of jungle, spewing putrid fumes off combusting biofuel. Every engine to date has sustained itself on blubber: the only whalers of the island being con-tracted under L.A. Their profession regarded beneath most, the whalers are a quiet folk, dwelling almost exclusively in the most secluded homes of their villages. Their ostracism has never been made official, but most practice a modest disliking towards them. If not for ethical disapproval, then jealousy: their homes stone built, furnished; brimming with bronze appliances. The more devout to their work decorate their interiors with the spoils of war; most however settle for little more than the occasional framed tooth or bone utensil. Few distance their profession and home design entirely; fewer still opt out of the rewarded luxury completely, living conditionally alike to their neighbours.
</p>

<p>
One such whaler raised her only child - Michael - at the absolute heart of her village. His father, of the same forename, accompanied the boy at home while, early each morning, his mother would scurry off to attend her covert employment&#x2026;
