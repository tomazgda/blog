* The First

My love is painted in the dark.
My eyes drape shut;
and your scene starts.
Sparks dance bright.
The world fades away.
I open my eyes;
and close them again.

* The Second
#+begin_verse
A melting pot of thoughts today:
Weighed by notes of joy and shame.
Music played by yesterday,
wrought by a progress I had to make,
lifts me now to think up-beat.
Yet heart-beats doubt this new-made peace.

Energy tunes my song too loud.
A head swole large, a boastfull sound.
The moment takes me, I listen too scarce
I can't hear you, I can barely hear myself.
