Time is free to work woe or wonder.
Fleeting time stirs minds insane.
Streching time compels creation.
Frozen time reflects love or pain

A deity is time in essence,
yet trivial is time's presence:
I need... I've got...
I've made... time tangible to us.

It is time that we strive for;
time we lust and crave.
So ashamed of our time wasted,
lest time take our world away.
