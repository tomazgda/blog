I grew up with the internet. It's a place that to me feels so permanent. I'd like, in that permanence, some of myself to be reflected. Like everyone, I have things to say - and I want to say them somewhere. That's what this is, or at least what I intend it to be. Some things may not be good; some I hope will be. In all likelihood, like everything, they'll come out a mixed bag. Thoughts, poems, stories: these are my things. And I hope you enjoy them!
